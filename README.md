## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Implementation

### 1. Image Preprocessing Optimization
```python
def preprocess_frame(self, frame):
    # Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE)
    lab = cv2.cvtColor(frame, cv2.COLOR_BGR2LAB)
    clahe = cv2.createCLAHE(clipLimit=3.0, tileGridSize=(8,8))
    cl = clahe.apply(l)
    enhanced = cv2.merge((cl,a,b))
```
- CLAHE technology for enhanced image contrast
- LAB color space conversion for improved color recognition
- Adaptive histogram equalization for better performance under varying lighting conditions

### 2. Multi-feature Fusion Detection
- Combines multiple key features for comprehensive scoring:
  * Color features (HSV space dual threshold)
  * Shape features (circularity analysis)
  * Brightness features (intensity distribution)
  * Spatial features (density calculation)

### 3. Intelligent Threshold System
```python
self.params = {
    'red_lower1': np.array([0, 120, 160]),    # Lower bound for red range 1
    'red_upper1': np.array([15, 255, 255]),   # Upper bound for red range 1
    'red_lower2': np.array([160, 120, 160]),  # Lower bound for red range 2
    'red_upper2': np.array([180, 255, 255]),  # Upper bound for red range 2
}
```
- Carefully calibrated dual threshold ranges
- Adaptive brightness threshold
- Dynamic area constraints
